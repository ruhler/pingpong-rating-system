* Combine Data and Params into a single structure?
* Make 'K' a parameter in addition to S2.
* Make error threshold a parameter too.
* Move definition of Params and S2 to the top of rate.c.
* Use consistent naming style for sse_ vs. other functions.
* Use same notation (variable names) in program as in document, as best as
  possible.
